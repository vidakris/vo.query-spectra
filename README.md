# vo.query-spectra
A small tool to query the Virtual Observatory for spectral data

Additional python packages needed:
* PyVO
* astropy
* getopt

To use the code, simply run `./vo.query-spectra.py <TARGET>` (where TARGET is the search target to be resolved by CDS), for a list of command-line options use `./vo.query-spectra.py --help`.
